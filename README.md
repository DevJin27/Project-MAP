# üß≠ Project-MAP: Maverick Admin Panel

This is the codebase for your very own **Maverick Admin Panel** ‚Äî a sleek, functional, and powerful control center for drone operations.

You're building this from scratch using:

- ‚ö° **FastAPI** ‚Äì for the backend logic and APIs  
- ‚öõÔ∏è **React (JSX)** ‚Äì for a clean, modern frontend UI  
- üì° **MAVLink** ‚Äì to communicate with your drone  
- üß† **ROS2** ‚Äì for robotics-level control  
- üõ¢Ô∏è **MySQL / SQLAlchemy** ‚Äì to store and analyze telemetry data

---

## üöÄ What's the Goal?

Create a **live drone monitoring and control panel** that:

- Displays real-time telemetry data (altitude, speed, GPS, etc.)
- Lets you send basic commands/scripts to the drone
- Is extendable to work with real drones or simulators
- Looks good while doing it üòé

> **Note:** This project is also being used as a way to **learn FastAPI and React from scratch** while building something meaningful and fun.
